Current state:
We can upload a .png file successfully to the new folder we created to store pictures (/Profile_Pics)
There are functions to take an Lnumber and convert it to a hashed string using MD5().
We have a few ways to validate the file, but commented them out in our testing.

What's left to do:
-modifying upload_Picture function in uploads.php
-display Smiley.png if no user profile picture is present
